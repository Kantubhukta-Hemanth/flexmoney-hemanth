This Project is mainly implementing the following features:

To build an admission form for the Yoga Classes which happen every month.

Requirements for the admission form are:
          - Only people within the age limit of 18-65 can enroll for the monthly classes and they will
          be paying the fees on a month on month basis. I.e. an individual will have to pay the fees
          every month and he can pay it any time of the month.
          - They can enroll any day but they will have to pay for the entire month. The monthly fee is
          500/- Rs INR.
          - There are a total of 4 batches a day namely 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM and 5-6PM. The
          participants can choose any batch in a month and can move to any other batch next
          month. I.e. participants can shift from one batch to another in different months but in
          same month they need to be in same batch


Implementation Approch:
        
        1) I have mainly used WAMPP for Development
        2) Technologies used:
                Front-end : HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JQuery
                Back-end  : PHP
                Database  : MySQL
        3) I have assumed the users to be a new customers for the portal
        4) The portal checks if the user alerady exists and alert him
        5) It automatically fetches the data of the existing user once he enters his email
        6) He can renewal his credentials by paying the fees right away
